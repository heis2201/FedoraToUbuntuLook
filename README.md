# Make Gnome in Fedora Workstation look like in Ubuntu

Do you love Fedora Workstation (Gnome) but prefer the look of Ubuntu's Gnome desktop? 
Hereâ€™s a simple, non-interactive shell script that transforms Fedora's Gnome to look like Ubuntu by setting up:
 - The Yaru theme for Gnome Shell, icons, cursor and legacy gtk apps. Yaru provides a large number of different themes with different color nuances. Use Gnome Tweaks to adjust them manually if you don't like Yaru-dark
 - A themed Gnome Terminal (using the Gogh script)
 - Ubuntu fonts
